Patterns - Nested Loops
 - Won't be asked in companies but highly needed in holding command in Loops
 and loop count up to interviews - solving problems

 RULES:
 1. For the outer loop, count the number of lines
 2. For the inner loop, focus on the columns
    Connect them somehow to the rows.
 3. Whatever you're printing, print them inside the inner loop
 4. Observe symmetry [optional, applicable only for some patterns]
